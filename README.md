# autoEdit 2

autoEdit 2 is a fast text based video editing, desktop app for Mac, Linux and Windows, built with node and electron, and Backbone front end. For making video production faster, easier and more accessible.


## Ready to use release 

See [releases section](https://github.com/OpenNewsLabs/autoEdit_2/releases) to download latest packaged version ready to use. And view [user manual](https://pietropassarelli.gitbooks.io/autoedit2-user-manual/content/) for overview of the app.

All you need to get started is to decide what speech to text service you want to use and get some credentials to get going [check out the user manual for more details](https://pietropassarelli.gitbooks.io/autoedit2-user-manual/content/setup-stt-apis.html) 

## Setup

```bash
git clone git@github.com:OpenNewsLabs/autoEdit_2.git
```

```
cd autoEdit_2
```

 ```bash
npm install
``` 

## Usage - development

```
npm start
```

Compiles the js client side files with browserify and starts electron

_Note:_ You'd also need to get Speech to text keys or have the Gentle Open source app running locally [check out the user manual for more details](https://pietropassarelli.gitbooks.io/autoedit2-user-manual/content/setup-stt-apis.html), unless you are chosing `pocketsphinx` as speech to text option.


## System Architecture
_High level overview of system architecture_

### High level Overview

1. autoEdit uses Speech to text services to create automatic transcription from a video or audio file
2. the user can make text selections 
3. export those selections as a video sequence in the editing software of choice

See [See use rmanual ](https://pietropassarelli.gitbooks.io/autoedit2-user-manual) and diagram below for more details.

### Background 
autoEdit, it's a text based video editing software that creates a digital paper-editing workflow. For more backaground see this write up on Source ["Introducing autoEdit"](https://source.opennews.org/articles/video-editing-made-better-introducing-autoedit/) as well as for more in depth on the underlying workflow [see this gitbook  "How to tell compelling stories out of video interviews"](https://pietropassarelli.gitbooks.io/how-to-tell-compelling-stories-out-of-video-inter/content/), and [especially this section focused on digital Paper-editing](https://pietropassarelli.gitbooks.io/how-to-tell-compelling-stories-out-of-video-inter/content/digital-paper-editing/autoedit-2-digital-paper-editing-software.html).

#### Backbone app
The backbone app is in `lib/app` for troubleshooting you can use `cmd`+ `alt` +`i` to ge the electron developer console, and there you have `appTranscription` and `appPaperedit` two backbone routers in the gloabl `window` scope that give you access to getting to individual backbone models and collections for transcriptions and paper-edit.

#### `Backbone.sync` 
Is designed so that the front end in backbone can be used as standalone static site. Which is how [the demo](https://opennewslabs.github.io/autoEdit_2/demo/index.html) is run, with an hard coded sample data in `backbone.sync`.

In the `electron` app `backbone.sync` overrides the backbone API methods.
This is set in `./lib/app/app.js` as 
`Backbone.sync = window.DB;` where `DB` is set in `./electrong/db.js`.

This is also a workaround for electron different ways of threating node and javascript depending on how they are added to the project. 

If you use `require` in the html file, then you are in node context, and can use module like `fs` but if you use a script tag, then you are in js client side code and don't have access to thos function. 

The downside of being in node context on the client side, without using a bundle like browserify and requring modules directly is that the front end is no longer portable as standalone client side web app if needed, eg for the demo page.

`DB` in `./electrong/db.js` allows to connect the backbone front to the `medeadown`/ `linvodb3` databse locally. As well as trigger `./lib/interactive_transcription_generator` component to at a high level
- read metadata of the media file, for the EDL sequence
- create video preview
- create audio version to send to STT APIs

#### electron
Code of the electron app is in the `./electron` folder.


#### `ffmpeg` and `electrong`
autoEdit uses `ffmpeg` under the hood, and getting `ffmpeg` and `electron` to work can sometimes be problematic when setting up a new app, so [I wrote here](http://pietropassarelli.com/ffmpeg-electron.html) about how this setup works in autoEdit, with semplified example.

### STT 

The app uses the following Speech To Text systems to generate transcription

- [X] IBM watson(free trial + paid), 
- [X] Speechmatics(free trial + paid), 
- [X] Gentle(open source) 
- [X] pocketsphinx (open source) 
- [ ] Rev.com (human transcriptions)

The user can then select text and export a video sequence to the video editing software of choice.

###  Documentation for developers

For more info check out the [project documentation](https://pietropassarelli.gitbooks.io/autoedit-2-documentation/content/)

- [ ] documentation is out of date and needs cleaning up, sudgestions on how to improve this welcome

<!-- For development I also use an [R&D planning doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aQ8MzevowNq2QrK77cT0Bh46xeq4ABxoV93FD85MCkM/edit?usp=sharing) that helps me plan architectural and components choices, evaluate different options and keep track of what has or hasn't worked over time.-->

There is also a google doc for a ["QA Test Plan autoEdit 2"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18hqjb5K7owSV6HJ-uqgeFwxicRUvf-nYsdpJiBkF-BU/edit?usp=sharing), which was original used with Vox Media QA team. It is now not up to date to the paper-editing features, but is comprehensive enough for the test. And a great starting point to make a new one.
 

## Development env

 _How to run the development environment_
_Coding style convention ref optional, eg which linter to use_
_Linting, github pre-push hook - optional_

- node 
- npm 
- [speech to text credentials](https://pietropassarelli.gitbooks.io/autoedit2-user-manual/content/setup-stt-apis.html)

### linting 

Use [`.eslintrc.json`](./.eslintrc.json) in your code editor of choice to keep style consistency.

## Build
_How to run build_
<!-- 
https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/wiki/Multi-Platform-Build#linux
-->

### Build: Mac OSX
Building and packaging the app, can be done with one comand. 

```bash
npm run build:mac:dmg
```

This install dependencies, runs browserify on the client side js code, builds the electron application in the `./dist` folder and packages into a `.dmg` image which is saved into the `~/dist` folder as well. 

If you'd rather a `.zip` file instead of the `.dmg` then you can run 

```
npm run pack:mac
```

### Build: Linux

```bash
npm run build:linux
```

This creates an `.AppImage` that works across linux distribution see deployment section and this [issue](https://github.com/OpenNewsLabs/autoEdit_2/issues/36) and corresponding [PR](https://github.com/OpenNewsLabs/autoEdit_2/pull/45) for more details.

### Build: Windows

You need to be a on a windows machine to build for Windows

```bash
npm run build:win
```

<!-- https://www.davidbaumgold.com/tutorials/wine-mac/ -->

## Tests

_How to carry out tests_

At the moment some unit tests are in the `spec` folder using `jasmine`, and you can run them using

```
npm run test
```

However they still need to be fixed up a bit. And perhaps move to `jest`.

- [ ] PR and help on improving test coverage welcome.

## Deployment

_How to deploy the code/app into test/staging/production_

There is no deployment as such as it's electron app, so the build described above serves as a packaging of the app for release.

However As of version `1.0.8` support is added for Linux thanks to [@probonopd](https://github.com/probonopd) [#36](https://github.com/OpenNewsLabs/autoEdit_2/issues/36).

On commit to  master there is a continuos built setup on Travis CI that builds and adds an up to date linux release to the release section under [Continuous build](https://github.com/OpenNewsLabs/autoEdit_2/releases/tag/continuous)

- [ ] PR and help welcome on creating a continuos integration service for Mac and Windows as well



## Build project page
The project page is visible at [autoedit.io/demo](http://www.autoedit.io).To edit the project page go to `./project_page` flder and edit the [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) site.

To update the project page run

```
npm run make_page
```

This copyies from the `./project_page` folder (that also contains the demo front end) to [the `/docs` folder](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages/) in this repo used to publish with [github page](https://pages.github.com/).

This comand also updates the demo front end ([autoedit.io/demo](http://www.autoedit.io/demo)). To update project page without updating demo front end code `npm run preview_page_no_demo_reload`.

The project page is a jeckyll site, and can be previewed locally using

```
npm run preview_page
```

Then visit [http://127.0.0.1:4000/](http://127.0.0.1:4000/)

## Build/update demo front end page

[autoedit.io/demo](http://www.autoedit.io/demo) contains a dummy demo of the front end, to update this after substantial changes to the app, run

```
npm run make_demo
```

This runs browserify to bundle the client side code and copies the `./electron` folder into the `./project_page/demo` folder.
